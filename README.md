This repoisitory includes data and R-code for the study on "Determination of optimal tree height models and calibration designs for Araucaria araucana and Nothofagus pumilio in mixed stands affected to different levels by anthropogenic disturbance in south-central Chile" by Zhou X, Kutchartt E, Hernández J, Corvalán P, Promis Á, Zwanzig M, 2022

The raw data collected by the project is given in the file "Araucaria-Nothofagus_raw_data.csv"

The code that was used for the analysis presented in the above-mentioned manuscript is given in "all_code.R", including references to data subsets.

Furthermore, an example for the re-calibration of tree height models with the data measured in a new stand is given in "Calibration-for-Araucaria-araucana.pdf".

Feel free to reuse and modify the code for your own analysis. In such a case, it is very welcome if the above manuscript is cited.
